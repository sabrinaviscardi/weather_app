<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I am the weather_app</h1>

<h2 align="left">API</h2>
<p align="left">In order to put into practice API calls, I played and code this web. Thanks to https://openweathermap.org/api and to the navigator geolocation I was able to get the weather from your current city and show it to you!</p>

<h2 align="left">What did I use?</h2>
<p align="left">I used HTML5 for markup and CSS3 to style the web product. But most important, I used Javascrpit to get the weather from the API and change icon and value of the Weather.</p>
<p align="left">The web is responsive! 🤝 </p>

<h2 align="left">How is your day? 🌞</h2>
